# Deep Neural Network Pretraining
> April-May 2020 : Master 2 Data Science at Ecole Polytechnique in France

The aim of this project was to build Deep Neural Networks pre-trained or not for the MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification task. We compared the performances in terms of classification error rate of a pre-trained network and a randomly initialized network by varying the number of layers, the number of neurons and the number of training images.
